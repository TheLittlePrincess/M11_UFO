# UFO sightings

## Overview

Through this project Dana’s webpage was made more dynamic. Also, it now provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, now the sightings can be filtered by city, state, country, and/or shape.

## Results

## How to use the site?
1.	Go to any of the available filters to the leftside of the page: Date, City, Sate, Country and Shape

2.	Enter the data in the sample format shown for each box. You can use one or more at a time.

3.	Click enter

Tip: Most data is in the US, enter the two letter state first to narrow down the search

## Summary 

The additional filtering allows for a much better experience, however some of the ideas of how to improve it are: 

•	Being so strict with the format can cause some users to miss to find what they are looking for, for instance if entered Co instead of co in the State filter, nothing comes up. As an attempt to help with that, I added i.e. on the place holder data, that might help guide the user

•	More data would be great, since urrently most of it is for the US and Canada, to that extend, while the country option is so limited, having a dropdown for such filter would be more efficient than the existing one.

•	It would be nice if the filtering began as the filter criteria is being typed in instead of waiting to click enter.
